## SunToWater

## In this project there are 3 people: Jos√©, Hugo and Guilherme

# Summary 

GlobeX aims to update and reconfigure the outdated IT infrastructure of its newly acquired subsidiary companies by implementing Active Directory and Domain Controller with Radius Authentication. This is to maintain regulatory compliance required for federal contracts, which is currently not being met due to the outdated IT systems.

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:
The MVP for GlobeX would be a successful implementation of Active Directory and Domain Controller with Radius Authentication for at least one of its newly acquired subsidiary companies. The demo should showcase the improved compliance with federal regulations and the optimized functionality of the IT system achieved through this implementation.
